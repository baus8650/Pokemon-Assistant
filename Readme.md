#  Welcome to Pokemon Search!
### Your own personal Pokedex for all the times you forget what is strong/weak to other types of Pokemon!

This app uses the PokeAPI https://pokeapi.co to look up the types of a Pokemon where you can tap on each type to see its efficacy on other types. You can directly search for a type to bypass looking at a specific Pokemon as well. Each Pokemon features an "Attack Strategy" button that will calculate its type(s) to display which types are strong/weak both offensively and defensively. This is especially useful for dual-type Pokemon. You can also click on each type to view all the Pokemon that are of that type and selecting any of these pokemon will bring you to their detail page. 

This app is basically just practice for making API calls and parsing JSON. Always looking for suggestions!
