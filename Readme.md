#  Welcome to Pokemon Search!
### Your own personal Pokedex for all the times you forget what is strong/weak to other types of Pokemon!

This app uses the PokeAPI https://pokeapi.co to look up the types of a Pokemon where you can tap on each type to see its efficacy on other types. You can directly search for a type to bypass looking at a specific Pokemon as well.

This app is basically just practice for making API calls and parsing JSON. Currently working on dual-type Pokemon but will welcome any feedback!
